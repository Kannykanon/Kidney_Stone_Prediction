# Kidney_Stone_Prediction
This dataset can be used to predict the presence of kidney stones based on urine analysis.
The 79 urine specimens, were analyzed in an effort to
determine if certain physical characteristics of the urine might be related to the
formation of calcium oxalate crystals.
The six physical characteristics of the urine are: 
(1) **specific gravity**, the density of the urine relative to water; 
(2) **pH**, the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion; 
(3) **osmolarity (mOsm)**, a unit used in biology and medicine but not in
physical chemistry. Osmolarity is proportional to the concentration of
molecules in solution; 
(4) **conductivity (mMho milliMho).** One Mho is one
reciprocal Ohm. Conductivity is proportional to the concentration of charged ions in solution; 
(5) **urea concentration** in millimoles per litre; and 
(6) **calcium concentration (CALC)** in millimolesllitre.

With the rise in kidney problem in Nigeria and the world at large, It is Important to take measures towards early diagnosis of this health challenge in order to prompt early treatment.
Machine learning model used in this project attempts to provide accurate diagnosis based on the data provided. 
I used DecisionTreeClassifier for this project.
